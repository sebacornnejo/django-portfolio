## Description

My personal portfolio is developed in Django and consists of several sections, each with its corresponding HTML file:

- Home
- About Me
- Skills
- Portfolio (General)
- Portfolio (Academic)
- Contact
- Frequent Questions
- Blog

Additionally, I've used static CSS files for styles and effects, as well as static JS files to implement effects and behaviors on the site, such as preload, carousel, scroll transitions, and mouse behavior. GSAP has been integrated for menu deployment.
